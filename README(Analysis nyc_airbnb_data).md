## Executive Summary
- The following analysis delves into the exploration of investment opportunities within various neighborhoods based on Airbnb data. After meticulous examination, we have isolated the top 10 neighborhoods exhibiting promising potential for investment. Upon thorough consideration, the Lower East Side emerged as the most auspicious locale, showcasing unparalleled revenue prospects. Our scrutiny primarily centered on scrutinizing 1 and 2-bedroom listings, meticulously filtering out those with ratings below 4 stars. Additionally, we incorporated the occupancy rate into our assessment, enabling us to project the potential annual revenue for each property within our scope.
